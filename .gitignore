# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/app/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
/app/.env*
!/app/.env*.erb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/app/log/*
/app/tmp/*
!/app/log/.keep
!/app/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/app/tmp/pids/*
!/app/tmp/pids/
!/app/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
/app/tmp/storage/*
!/app/tmp/storage/
!/app/tmp/storage/.keep

/app/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/app/config/master.key
